# Homework 1: HTML and CSS Exercise
## Objectives
Become familiar with HTML and CSS technologies to initiate a web page

## Description
You should be able to compose documents directly in HTML and CSS. This is very helpful as it is often necessary to modify existing documents. Also, when writing server-side scripts one must generate HTML.

* In this assignment you are given an image of a web page. Your task is to reproduce the page as closely as possible, writing HTML and CSS directly, that is without using anything more than a text editor. Snapshots of the web page to be imitated, for 3 browsers can be found in Appendix-A.
* Note: use of CSS is required. The styles should be defined in a separate .css file
* You will need one (1) image to complete the web page: sayhello.png
* Please note that if you view the images of the web page in a browser, some browsers will automatically resize the image to fit within the browser.
* The page contains five (5) active links/buttons within the text. The five links/buttons are labeled “No. 13”, “Get in Touch / Say Hello”, “Read our Latest Article”, “Sign Up”, and “Contact Us”. 4 e-mail addresses are also active, i.e. they invoke a mail client.
* On the page you are going to build, the active links should be made to point to a different page, say X.html at your website. The page X.html should be divided into nine parts, each separated by a horizontal line. Each part will begin with a paragraph tag that looks like this

```<p id=”Home”>```

This is the start of X.html which corresponds to the “Home” link.

* You are to construct the five (5) links so that when a person clicks on a link, (e.g. they click on “Home”) the page X.html is displayed and the section of X.html that has the corresponding name as the name of the link, is placed at the top, (i.e. the page scrolls up).
* To test your hw#1, please view your web page using Firefox. Resize your browser window to the same size as the PNG image and then see if you have used the correct font, color and size, and if the position of text is correct.
